## Overview

This project is a Golang-based REST API designed to manage users, groups, and roles within a PostgreSQL database. It provides complete CRUD operations for each entity, along with specific endpoints to handle the relationships between users, groups, and roles. The API is optimized to run on Google Cloud Run.

## Features

- **Users**: Create, update, delete, and manage user details. Query users by UID or search by name.
- **Groups**: Manage groups, including adding/removing users from groups.
- **Roles**: Assign roles to users, manage role details including rights stored as JSON.
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secure endpoints using JWT tokens.
- **Dynamic Database Selection**: Middleware dynamically selects the database based on the authorization header.
